/**
 * `EnvelopeCipher` that seals under the provider's active key and opens under whichever key an envelope names.
 *
 * `SodiumEnvelopeCipher` holds exactly one key, which is correct for the primitive and wrong for a system that
 * has to keep running while its keys change. This wraps it: encryption asks the provider for the active key,
 * decryption asks for the key the stored envelope names, and each call delegates to a single-key cipher bound to
 * that one key. Rotation therefore never means trying keys until one works, exactly one key is ever attempted
 * and it is chosen by identifier, and an envelope whose key the deployment no longer holds is reported as
 * unavailable rather than as a failed authentication.
 *
 * The algorithm is pinned twice over: `EncryptedEnvelope` refuses to construct anything but the supported
 * construction, and this class re-checks the field it was handed, so a stored row edited to name a weaker
 * construction is refused before a key is touched rather than after. A provider that answers a request for one
 * identifier with a key of another is refused the same way, before its bytes are used.
